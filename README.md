0. Finetune Xception (whole)
1. Finetune Xception (how small can the model be?)
2. Model with small set of data
3. model with small data, try with augmentation
4. Introduce 'tricks' (dropout, batchnorm...)
5. Optuna for hyperparameters (including batchnorm, dropout...)
6. Visualize the feature maps for a certain model (I advance you, the solution is the maxpooling)
